## Focus on your goals

This simple project is a single website for daily use.
You enter your goals, break them down into individual sessions, set durations of the sessions and the breaks in between, and then start working on them.
During the work sessions, brown noise helps to filter out potential background noise. During breaks the noise takes a break as well.
Everything happens inside your browser, you can just download the file and run it locally.
